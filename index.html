Understanding your electricity bill can be confusing, but I'm here to break it down for you in simple terms.</p>
        
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Let's start with the basics. MEPCO, which stands for Multan Electric Power Company, is the company responsible for providing electricity to many areas. Your electricity bill is like a report card for your electricity usage. It tells you how much electricity you've used and how much you need to pay.</p>
        
        <h2>Accessing Your Online Electricity Bill</h2>
        <p>First things first, you need to log in to the MEPCO online portal. You can usually find this on their website. Once you're logged in, look for the section that says "Billing" or something similar. Here, you'll find all the information about your bill.</p>
        
        <h2>Components of Your Electricity Bill</h2>
        <p>Your bill is made up of different parts. The billing period tells you the dates for which you're being charged. The meter reading details show how much electricity you've used since the last reading. Then there's the tariff information, which is like the price list for electricity. The consumption details tell you how much electricity you've used in units.</p>
        
        <h2>Understanding Consumption Units</h2>
        <p>Units are like the building blocks of your electricity usage. They're measured in something called kilowatt-hours (kWh). Don't worry about the fancy name; just think of them as the amount of electricity you use. The more units you use, the higher your bill will be.</p>
        
        <h2>Payment Options and Due Dates</h2>
        <p>Now, let's talk about paying your bill. MEPCO offers different ways to pay, like online or at a bank. Make sure you pay on time to avoid any extra charges. The due date is the deadline for payment.</p>
        
        <h2>Understanding Tariff Structures</h2>
        <p>Tariffs are like the different price plans for electricity. There are different tariffs for homes, businesses, and industries. The tariff rates determine how much you pay for each unit of electricity.</p>
        
        <h2>Tips for Managing Your Electricity Usage</h2>
